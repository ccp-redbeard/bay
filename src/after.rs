//! G273 (N-16): a change that lands only after others. `bay start --after <change>`
//! (repeatable) records the changes a change depends on in its record's `after`. The change may
//! be checked and queued at once, but the executor publishes it only once every change it names
//! has landed on trunk: the remote holds that change's landed marker and trunk reaches the
//! commit it names ([`crate::undo::landed_commit`]). Until then the operation waits with
//! `DEPENDENCY_PENDING` and holds no queue place (`crate::publish`). A named change that ended
//! without landing (abandoned, superseded or no effect) can never be followed, so the dependent
//! is refused `DEPENDENCY_ABANDONED`. The landing of the dependent carries one trailer per
//! change it named, `Bay-After: <change>`.
//!
//! Unknown is never landed: a change whose chain the remote does not answer for is pending, with
//! the fault named.
//!
//! BACKLOG 157 (a fleet finding, 2026-10-30: an operation waited on a change that had no merge
//! request, and 39% of one runner's journal lines were that wait, which said only that it waits):
//! a named change with no operation under way is not submitted. The wait names it and its actor,
//! who must `bay merge` it, and the chain head it was read at, which only a request, a landing or
//! an end moves (`crate::executor` visits the wait again then).
//!
//! G604 (a fleet finding, 2026-10-31: an operation waited 22 minutes on a change whose only
//! operation a runner had blocked, and each of 34 journal lines said only that it waits): a
//! named change whose every open operation is blocked is stopped. It moves again only once a
//! person acts on it (its actor, or an approver for an approval), so the wait names it, its
//! actor, the blocked operation and its reason, and is parked on its chain head like a change
//! that is not submitted.
