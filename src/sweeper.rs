//! G619 (a fleet finding, 2026-11-01: at load 100 to 155 a sweep of a hosted remote took about
//! 34 s, and every `bay status` waited for it): a status read starts its sweep as a process of its
//! own (`bay sweep`, hidden) and waits for it only until its deadline. Past it, the read answers
//! from the store as the last sweep left it and names how old that is (`stale_read`); the sweep
//! runs on to its end, settles the store and records itself, so the reads after it are fresh.
//!
//! Why a process of its own (measured on a loaded server, 2026-11-01): a caller waits for the exit
//! of the process it started, not for its output. A process that closed its stdout and stderr and
//! then worked 2 s more held `x=$(...)` 2.007 s, a pipe 2.025 s and Python's `subprocess.run` 2.24
//! s; a detached child with no stdio held `$(...)` 0.014 s after its parent exited. A sweep cut at
//! the deadline would never end at that load, and the store would only grow older.
//!
//! The sweep holds the store's sweep lock ([`crate::sweep::lock`]) for its whole life, so a store
//! runs one at a time, and it ends by the git calls' own timeouts. A read that finds a sweep
//! running waits for that one ([`wait_ended`]) and starts none.
